# ToDo List App

This is a simple ToDo List application built using React Native. The app allows users to add, check off, and delete tasks. It provides real-time feedback on the number of tasks completed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks by typing into the text input and pressing the "Add" button.
- **Task Validation:** The app checks if the task input is empty or too short before adding it to the list.
- **Mark as Done:** Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the "Done" checkbox, which applies a line-through style to the task.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list by pressing the "Delete" checkbox.
- **Task Summary:** The app displays a summary of the number of completed tasks out of the total number of tasks.
